I am a Lecturer in Cybersecurity at the [Faculty of Science and Engineering](https://www.mq.edu.au/about/about-the-university/faculties-and-departments/faculty-of-science-and-engineering), [Computing Department](https://www.mq.edu.au/about/about-the-university/faculties-and-departments/faculty-of-science-and-engineering/departments-and-centres/department-of-computing), Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia. Previousely, I was a joint postdoctoral research fellow at University of Michigan and Macquarie University. I received my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from UNSW, under the supervision of [Prof. Mohamed Ali (Dali) Kaafar](https://dali-kaafar.github.io).

I am interested in analysing security and privacy issues in Web and mobile platforms. Over the last couple of years, I have been thinking and working to build techniques leveraging machine-learning algorithms to fight against security and privacy issues and fraud detection targeting online services. Please refer to my publications to get some further insights of my research interests.
